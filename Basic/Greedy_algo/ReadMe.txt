------------------------- GREEDY ALGORITHM ------------------------

Algorithms:
	1. Brute force
	2. Divide and Conquer
	3. Greedy Algorithm
	4. Dynamic Programming

Greedy Algo, ex:
	let coins[] = {1,2,5,10,20,50,100.200}

Make a total of 73, using greedy approach:
	step1: biggest one lower than 73, =>50
		73 - 50 =23

	step2: biggest one lower than 23
		23 - 20 = 3

	step3: 3 - 2 =1

	step4: 1 -1 =0

Advantage of Greedy: 
	Fast

Disadvantage:
	Cannot be applied to all

Usually greedy questions have large constraints
